### What is that?
OpenCraft is a project created by the Minecraft community.

### Our objectives
We want to make a clone exactly like Minecraft and make it open-source. I know there are many ways to decompile Minecraft, but it is illegal to share modified copies of it or share its source code. That's why we want to make a copy exactly the same, that fulfills the same purposes, but that the community has the rights to do what they want with their own version of the game (as long as it doesn't impersonate official pages or impersonate us).

### Why all this?
We believe that if the community does not play an important role in each game, it will be destined to die. The community has the same level of importance as the game itself, because, after all, it is what keeps the game alive.
